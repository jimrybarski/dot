# Git Workflow and Versioning

## When to use

Always, when working in (or creating) version-controlled codebases.

## Core Principles

### Trunk-based development (recommended)

Keep `main` always deployable. Work on the `main` branch for small changes, and use feature branches whenever the change will be large, complex, or risky.

### Commit early, commit often

Each successful increment gets its own commit. Don't accumulate large uncommitted changes.

```
Work pattern:
  Implement slice → test → verify → commit → next slice
```

Commits are save points. If the next change breaks something, you can revert to the last known-good state instantly.

### Atomic commits

Each commit does one logical thing:

```
# Good: Each commit is self-contained
git log --oneline
a1b2c3d Add task creation endpoint with validation
d4e5f6g Add task creation form component
h7i8j9k Connect form to API and add loading state
m1n2o3p Add task creation tests (unit + integration)

# Bad: Everything mixed together
git log --oneline
x1y2z3a Add task feature, fix sidebar, update deps, refactor utils
```

### Descriptive messages

Commit messages explain the *why*, not just the *what*:

```
# Good: Explains intent
feat: add email validation to registration endpoint

Prevents invalid email formats from reaching the database.
Uses Zod schema validation at the route handler level,
consistent with existing validation patterns in auth.ts.

# Bad: Describes what's obvious from the diff
update auth.ts
```

**Format:**
```
<type>: <short description>

<optional body explaining why, not what>
```

**Types:**
- `feature` — New feature
- `fix` — Bug fix
- `refactor` — Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test` — Adding or updating tests
- `docs` — Documentation only
- `chore` — Tooling, dependencies, config

Do NOT sign Claude as a co-author.

### Keep concerns separate

Don't combine formatting changes with behavior changes. Don't combine refactors with features. Each type of change should be a separate commit — and ideally a separate PR:

```
# Good: Separate concerns
git commit -m "refactor: extract validation logic to shared utility"
git commit -m "feat: add phone number validation to registration"

# Bad: Mixed concerns
git commit -m "refactor validation and add phone number field"
```

**Separate refactoring from feature work.** A refactoring change and a feature change are two different changes — submit them separately. This makes each change easier to review, revert, and understand in history. Small cleanups (renaming a variable) can be included in a feature commit at reviewer discretion.

### Size your changes

Target ~100 lines per commit/PR. Changes over ~1000 lines should be split. See the splitting strategies in `code-review-and-quality` for how to break down large changes.

```
~100 lines  → Easy to review, easy to revert
~300 lines  → Acceptable for a single logical change
~1000 lines → Split into smaller changes
```

## Branching strategy

### Feature branches

```
main (always deployable)
  │
  ├── feature/task-creation    ← One feature per branch
  ├── feature/user-settings    ← Parallel work
  └── fix/duplicate-tasks      ← Bug fixes
```

- Branch from `main` (or the team's default branch)
- Delete branches after merge

### Branch Naming

```
feature/<short-description>   → feature/task-creation
fix/<short-description>       → fix/duplicate-tasks
chore/<short-description>     → chore/update-deps
refactor/<short-description>  → refactor/auth-module
```

## The save point pattern

```
Agent starts work
    │
    ├── Makes a change
    │   ├── Test passes? → Commit → Continue
    │   └── Test fails? → Revert to last commit → Investigate
    │
    ├── Makes another change
    │   ├── Test passes? → Commit → Continue
    │   └── Test fails? → Revert to last commit → Investigate
    │
    └── Feature complete → All commits form a clean history
```

This pattern means you never lose more than one increment of work. If an agent goes off the rails, `git reset --hard HEAD` takes you back to the last successful state.

## Change summaries

After any modification, provide a structured summary. This makes review easier, documents scope discipline, and surfaces unintended changes:

```
CHANGES MADE:
- src/routes/tasks.ts: Added validation middleware to POST endpoint
- src/lib/validation.ts: Added TaskCreateSchema using Zod
```

## Pre-Commit Hygiene

Before every commit:

```bash
# 1. Check what you're about to commit
git diff --staged

# 2. Ensure no secrets
git diff --staged | grep -i "password\|secret\|api_key\|token"

# 3. Run tests
`cargo test` or `pytest tests`

# 4. Run linting
`cargo fmt`

# 5. Run type checking
cargo clippy
```

Automate this with git hooks:

```json
// package.json (using lint-staged + husky)
{
  "lint-staged": {
    "*.{ts,tsx}": ["eslint --fix", "prettier --write"],
    "*.{json,md}": ["prettier --write"]
  }
}
```

## Handling Generated Files

- **Commit generated files** only if the project expects them (e.g., `Cargo.lock`)
- **Don't commit** build output (`dist/`, `.next/`), environment files (`.env`), or IDE config (`.vscode/settings.json` unless shared)
- **Have a `.gitignore`** that covers cache files, intermediate build artifacts, etc., appropriate to the language

## Using git for debugging

```bash
# Find which commit introduced a bug
git bisect start
git bisect bad HEAD
git bisect good <known-good-commit>
# Git checkouts midpoints; run your test at each to narrow down

# View what changed recently
git log --oneline -20
git diff HEAD~5..HEAD -- src/

# Find who last changed a specific line
git blame src/services/task.ts

# Search commit messages for a keyword
git log --grep="validation" --oneline
```

## Release & Versioning

Commits are how *you* track change; a **version** is how your *consumers* track it. The moment anything else depends on your code — another team, a published package, a deployed client — "latest on main" stops being a sufficient answer to "what am I running, and is it safe to upgrade?" A version number and a changelog are the contract that answers it.

Only libraries need versioning. Everything else I write is just for me.

### Semantic versioning

For anything with consumers, version `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` and let the number carry meaning:

```
  MAJOR  breaking change — consumers must change their code to upgrade
  MINOR  new functionality, backward-compatible — safe to upgrade
  PATCH  bug fix, backward-compatible — safe to upgrade
```

The number is a promise, so make the code match it. A "patch" that changes behavior consumers relied on is a major change wearing a disguise (Hyrum's Law — see the `api-and-interface-design` skill). When unsure whether a change is breaking, assume it is; a surprise major is far cheaper than a broken consumer.

### Tag the release, and let the tag be the source of truth

A release is an immutable point in history, not a moving branch. Tag it so it can always be reproduced:

```bash
git tag -a v1.4.0 -m "Release 1.4.0"
git push origin v1.4.0
```

Derive the version from the tag rather than hand-editing it in scattered files, so the artifact, the tag, and the changelog can never disagree.

### Keep a changelog written for humans

A changelog is not `git log`. It's the curated, consumer-facing answer to "what changed and do I care?" — grouped by `Added / Changed / Fixed / Deprecated / Removed / Security`, newest on top, every entry phrased around user impact, not internal mechanics.

```markdown
## [1.4.0] - 2025-06-12
### Added
- Bulk task import via CSV
### Fixed
- Timezone drift in recurring task due dates
### Deprecated
- `GET /v1/tasks/all` — use the paginated `GET /v1/tasks` (removal in 2.0)
```

Write the entry in the same change that makes the change, while the impact is fresh — not reconstructed from commit archaeology at release time.

## Red Flags

- Large uncommitted changes accumulating
- Commit messages like "fix", "update", "misc"
- Formatting changes mixed with behavior changes
- No `.gitignore` in the project
- Committing `node_modules/`, `.env`, or build artifacts
- Long-lived branches that diverge significantly from main
- Force-pushing to shared branches
- A breaking change shipped under a minor or patch version bump
- A release with no tag, or a version number hand-edited out of sync with the tag
- A user-facing release with no changelog entry, or a changelog that's just dumped commit messages

## Verification

For every commit:

- [ ] Commit does one logical thing
- [ ] Message explains the why, follows type conventions
- [ ] Tests pass before committing
- [ ] No secrets in the diff
- [ ] No formatting-only changes mixed with behavior changes
- [ ] `.gitignore` covers standard exclusions

For every release (anything with consumers):

- [ ] The version bump matches the change: breaking → major, additive → minor, fix → patch
- [ ] The release is tagged, and the version is derived from the tag, not hand-edited out of sync
- [ ] The changelog has a curated, human-readable entry grouped by impact for this version
